# IOE512 Dynamic Programing
## Final Project

### Getting started

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run?

```bash
$ python3 algorithms.py
```

### How to interpret the result?

* x axis is the infection rate (**TODO**: speaking of which, we need to add infection rate to 'state' in our report.)
* y axis is the storage level passed from the previous level

### Where to find the parameters to tune?

Parameters we can play around with are all listed in `data.py`.
Those are candidates for sensitivity analysis.
